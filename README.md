# DIVIEW
A GUI that facilitates organizing and visualizing SOLPS-ITER simulation data for divertor research. Divertor View - "DIVIEW"
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make plotting SOLPS-ITER simulation data easy. Although one can do all the data analyses and plotting using IPython notebooks, the process is generally very tedious and often contains redundancy. Therefore I developed this GUI to make it easier and more compact. For example, one does not need to create a notebook for every plot and end up with a countless amount of notebooks.
## Selected features
1. It provides the user an intuitive way to import and organize the data that respects the hierarchical nature.
2. A calculator allows the user to obtain new custom data using the standard data from the code.
3. A versatile color code system gives the user full flexibility to customizing the colorbar.
